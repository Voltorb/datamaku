Game Summary: 

The aim is to collect blue datagrams (bullets) while avoiding the red, to initiate (and survive) uploads and unlock high scoring potential!
As time goes on, and as you hit red datagrams, the threat level increases. Switch into 'incognito mode' and collect red/avoid blue to lower the threat! 
Always avoid green :)
Further instructions are in the game itself.
